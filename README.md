# NeuroDiagnosisML

## Project Overview
NeuroDiagnosisML is a machine learning project focused on early diagnosis of neurological diseases. The goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze neurological imaging data and detect early patterns associated with various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. This project aims to contribute to healthcare by providing tools for early and accurate diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes.

**Note: This project is currently under construction.** Future updates will include data processing scripts, model training examples, and evaluation tools.
